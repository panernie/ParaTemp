"""
Contains a class for containing multiple replica Universes in a single object.

This module defines a class that will contain Universes for each replica in a
replica exchange simulation.
While each replica can be defined individually, this adds a convenient
container for logically similar trajectories and allows easy iteration over
and access to the individual replica Universes.

    A class for working with MDAnalysis Universes from replica exchange sims.

    This class creates Universe objects for different simulations that all
    have the same topology (atoms, bonds, etc.), but different temperatures
    (not strictly required, though a 'temperature' needs to be specified for
    each).
    This class itself does not add much on top of
    :class:`~paratemp.coordinate_analysis.Universe` other than iteration over
    the replicas and creating them starting all from the same topology with
    different trajectories.

    An instance of this class can be indexed (with '[]'s) with either ints
    (to get the Universe with that index) or with strings that can be
    converted to floats to get the replica with the temperature nearest to
    that value.
